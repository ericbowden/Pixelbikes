===================

A more complex game server using [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/), [Socket.IO](http://socket.io/), and [enchant.js](http://enchantjs.com/)

In order to run first you have to install the modules:

    cd ~/projectdir
    sudo npm install
  
Then to start the server:

    node app.js
    
This will start the server on port 3000, navigate to http://localhost:3000/ in a browser

Other computers can connect to the server through your computer's IP address
